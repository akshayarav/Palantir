LeBron Raymone James Sr. (/ləˈbrɒn/[1] lə-BRON; born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed "King James", he is the NBA's all-time leading scorer and has won four NBA championships from 10 NBA Finals appearances, having made eight consecutive appearances between 2011 and 2018.[2] He also won the inaugural NBA Cup in 2023 with the Lakers and has won three Olympic gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team.

In addition to ranking fourth in NBA career assists and sixth in NBA career steals, James holds several individual honors, including four NBA MVP awards, four Finals MVP awards, the Rookie of the Year award, three All-Star Game MVP awards, the inaugural NBA Cup MVP, and the Olympics MVP in the 2024 Summer Olympics. A record 21-time All-Star and 20-time All-NBA selection (including a record 13 First Team selections), he has also made six All-Defensive Teams.[3][4] The oldest active player in the NBA, he is tied with Vince Carter for the most seasons played and holds the record for the most minutes played in league history.

Born and raised in Akron, Ohio, James gained national attention at St. Vincent–St. Mary High School and was heavily touted as a future NBA superstar for his all-around scoring, passing, athleticism and playmaking abilities.[5] A prep-to-pro, James was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. He won Rookie of the Year and quickly established himself as one of the league's premier players, leading Cleveland to its first NBA Finals appearance in 2007 and winning the scoring title in 2008. After winning back-to-back MVPs in 2009 and 2010, he left the Cavaliers and joined the Miami Heat as a free agent in 2010, a controversial move announced in the nationally televised special titled The Decision.[6]

With the Heat, James won his first two NBA championships in 2012 and 2013, earning MVP and Finals MVP honors both years. After four seasons in Miami, he returned to Cleveland in 2014, leading the Cavaliers to their first-ever championship in 2016 by overcoming a 3–1 deficit against the Golden State Warriors and ending the Cleveland sports curse. He signed with the Lakers in 2018, winning another title in 2020 and becoming the first player to win Finals MVP with three different teams. In 2023, he surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the NBA's all-time leading scorer, and in 2024, he and his son Bronny became the first father-son teammates in league history. In 2025, James - though still an active player - was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a member of the 2008 United States men's Olympic basketball team (also known as the "Redeem Team").[7]

Off the court, James has earned further wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He is the first player in NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player.[8] James has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning three Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer), and television commercials. He was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2005, 2013, 2017, and 2019 — the most selections for a professional athlete. James has won 20 ESPY Awards, hosted Saturday Night Live, and starred in the sports film Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). He has been a part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, which has opened an elementary school, housing complex, retail plaza, and medical center in Akron.[9][10]

Early life
LeBron Raymone James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, to Gloria Marie James, who was only 16 at the time of his birth.[11]: 22  His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not involved in his life.[12][13][14] When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work.[15] Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.[11]: 23 

James began playing organized basketball in the fifth grade.[16] He later played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.[15] The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee.[11]: 24  The group dubbed themselves the "Fab Four" and promised each other that they would attend high school together.[11]: 27  In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent–St. Mary High School, a private Catholic school with predominantly white students.[17]

High school
Basketball
As a 6-foot-2-inch (1.88 m) tall freshman, James averaged 18 points and 6.2 rebounds per game for the St. Vincent–St. Mary varsity basketball team.[18] The Fighting Irish went 27–0 en route to the Division III state title, making them the only boys high school team in Ohio to finish the season undefeated.[19] As a sophomore, James averaged 25.3 points and 7.4 rebounds, along with 5.5 assists and 3.7 steals per game.[20] For some home games during the season, St. Vincent–St. Mary played at the University of Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, as well as college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play.[21] The Fighting Irish finished the season 26–1 and repeated as state champions.[18] For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to do either.[18]

In 2001, during the summer before his junior year, James was the subject of a feature article in Slam magazine in which writer Ryan Jones lauded the 16-year-old James, who had grown to 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m), as "[possibly] the best high school basketball player in America right now".[22] During the season, James also appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, becoming the first high school basketball underclassman to do so.[11]: 104  With averages of 28 points, 8.9 rebounds, 6 assists, and 3 steals per game, he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team,[18] and became the first junior to be named male basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year.[11]: 117  St. Vincent–St. Mary finished the year with a 23–4 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game.[11]: 114  Following the loss, James unsuccessfully petitioned for a change to the NBA's draft eligibility rules in an attempt to enter the 2002 NBA draft.[23][24] During this time, he used marijuana, which he said was to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media attention he was receiving.[25]

Throughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled across the country to play several nationally ranked teams, including a game on December 12, 2002, against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2.[11]: 142  Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James's popularity, offered St. Vincent–St. Mary's games to Ohio-based subscribers for $7.95 per game on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season, but ended up not being profitable.[11]: 143 [26] For the year, James averaged 30.4 points, 9.7 rebounds, 4.9 assists, and 2.9 steals per game,[18] was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year,[11]: 178  and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year.[18] He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games—the EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Brand Capital Classic, and the McDonald's All-American Game—losing his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA draft.[27]

Also during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, James skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 as a gift from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing James's future earning power as an NBA player.[28] This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the luxury vehicle from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source.[27] Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in his being stripped of his high school sports eligibility.[27] James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season.[29] In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.[30] St. Vincent–St. Mary went on to win the Division II championship, marking their third division title in four years.[31]

Football
As an underclassman, James played wide receiver for St. Vincent–St. Mary's football team.[11]: 51  He was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame.[32] At the end of his second year, James was named first team all-state, and as a junior, he helped lead the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals.[20] James did not play during his senior year because of a wrist injury that he sustained in an AAU basketball game.[33] Some sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, as well as former and current professional players have speculated that James could have played in the National Football League (NFL).[a]

Professional career
Cleveland Cavaliers (2003–2010)
2003–2004: Rookie of the Year

James, pictured here in 2007, joined Oscar Robertson and Michael Jordan as the only players to average better than 20 points, five rebounds and five assists per game as rookies during his 2003–04 season.
James was selected by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft.[38] In his first regular season game, James scored 25 points in a 106–92 loss to the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for the most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance.[39] At the conclusion of the 2003–2004 season, James became the first Cavalier to receive the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.[40] With final averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game,[41] he also became the third player in league history to average at least 20 points, five rebounds, and five assists per game as a rookie.[42] Cleveland ultimately finished the season 35–47, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.[43]

2004–2008: Rise to superstardom
In the 2004–2005 season, James earned his first NBA All-Star Game selection, contributing 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference.[44] Around the league, teams took note of his rapid development, and Denver Nuggets coach George Karl told Sports Illustrated: "It's weird talking about a 20-year-old kid being a great player, but he is a great player ... He's the exception to almost every rule."[45] On March 20, James scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland's new single-game points record.[46] With final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to his first All-NBA Team.[20] Despite a 30–20 record to start the year,[46] the Cavaliers again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the season 42–40.[47]


James picks up his dribble against Caron Butler of the Washington Wizards in November 2006.
At the 2006 All-Star Game, James led the East to victory with 29 points and was named the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player.[48] Behind final season averages of 31.4 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game,[3] he also finished second in overall NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting to Steve Nash.[49] Under James' leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1998.[50] In his postseason debut, James recorded a triple-double in a winning effort over the Washington Wizards.[51] In Game 3 of the series, he made the first game-winning shot of his career, and made another in Game 5.[52] Cleveland would go on to defeat the Wizards before being ousted by the Detroit Pistons in the second round.[53]


James engages in his pre-game ritual of tossing crushed chalk into the air in March 2008; the routine was mostly ended after 2011.[54][55]
In the 2006–2007 season, James finished the regular season averaging 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 1.6 steals per game.[20] With a starting five featuring James, Larry Hughes, Drew Gooden, Aleksandar Pavlović, and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the #2-seed in the Eastern Conference.[56] In the first two rounds of the playoffs, LeBron led the team to wins over the Washington Wizards and New Jersey Nets. The Cavaliers then faced the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals, he logged 48 points with nine rebounds and seven assists. His performance is considered one of the greatest playoff performances of all time as he scored 29 of Cleveland's last 30 points, including 25 straight, and the game-winning layup with two seconds left. The Cavaliers won 109–107 double-overtime victory over the Detroit Pistons.[57] After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance "one of the greatest moments in postseason history" and color commentator Steve Kerr described it as "[Michael] Jordan-esque".[58] In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history.[59] The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their first-ever Eastern Conference championship, earning them a matchup with the San Antonio Spurs in the Finals.[60] The Spurs at the time were coached by Gregg Popovich and featured a prime Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginóbili, and Bruce Bowen. With no other significant scoring threats, the Spurs built its defense around stopping James from getting into the paint. As James did not have a reliable jump shot yet nor another offensive weapon on his team, he struggled against the Spurs' zone defense.[61] He averaged 22 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting,[62] as Cleveland was eliminated in a four-game sweep.[63]

In February of the 2007–2008 season, James was named All-Star Game MVP for the second time behind a 27-point, eight-rebound, and nine-assist performance.[64] On March 21, he moved past Brad Daugherty as the Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer in a game against the Toronto Raptors, doing so in over 100 fewer games than Daugherty.[65] James' 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, marking his first scoring title.[66] Despite his individual accomplishments, Cleveland's record fell from the year before to 45–37.[67] Seeded fourth in the East entering the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Wizards in the first round for the third consecutive season before being eliminated in seven games by the eventual-champion Boston Celtics in the next round.[68] During the decisive seventh game in Boston, James scored 45 points and Paul Pierce scored 41 in a game the Associated Press described as a "shootout".[69]
